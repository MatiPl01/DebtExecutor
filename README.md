# DebtExecutor

## Side info (14.12.2022):
- Removed login. Logging in by choosing user from predefined list.
- To create resource you have to send corresponding DTO (CreateGroupDTO, CreateUserDTO, CreateExpenseDTO).
- In Group.java when name is not passed to us - give empty string instead of null.
- Created separate endpoints for adding expense between users (v1/expenses/add/expense).
